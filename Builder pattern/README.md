# The Builder Pattern
## - creational type

## Goal: 
A Builder class builds the final object step by step. This builder is independent of other objects.
(It is also useful if you want to change a caonstuctor with a long parameterlist to a simple parameter.)

## Example: 
We want to build ourselves menus at a fast food restaurant. In my example we can order menus made by the builder pattern.
